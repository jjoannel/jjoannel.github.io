Hi! My name is Joanne, I graduated from CSU East Bay in 2020 with M.S. in Statistics with a focus in Data Science. I'm aspiring to pivot my career from business analytics to data science.

During my masters, I managed a small analytic team at a retail company, analyzed sales and product data, drove sales targets and operational efficiency. My experience also encompasses B2B sales operations and marketing campaign analysis.

Outside of data science, I have an interest in investing, social justice, climate change. I enjoy learning to snowboard and yoga, upcycling furniture and clothing.
