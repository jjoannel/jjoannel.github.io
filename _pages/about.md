Hi! My name is Joanne, I graduated from CSU East Bay in 2020 with M.S. in Statistics with a focus in Data Science. 

During my masters, I managed a team of business analysts at Benefit Cosmetics working with sales and product data that was used to drive sales targets and operational efficiency. Prior to that, I worked at Kaiser Permanente analyzing the B2B sales operations, and also analyzed marketing pre and post campaign performance.

I have an interest in business operations analytics and am aspiring to dive deeper into machine learning. Outside of data science, I enjoy learning to snowboard and yoga, thrift/upcycle furniture and clothing.
