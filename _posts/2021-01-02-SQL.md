This post focuses on setting up MySQL with mock data, reviewing SQL aggregations and advanced SQL windows functions commonly asked during SQL interviews. 

### Step 1: Setup MySQL
- Download and install to macOS applications [MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/)
- Open MySQL workbench, add a new connection (Local Host: 127.0.0.1, Port:3306), click on store in keychain to enter your laptop password 

#### Setup MySQL Command Line Client (optional)
You can either code directly on MySQL Workbench or MySQL in Command Line. Using the MySQL Command Line Client in Mac runs MySQL through the terminal. This allows you to run SQL scripts through command line or write sql scripts to text files.

1. Open Terminal
2. Find directory to call for mysql: cd /usr/local/mysql/bin Enter this: Use mysql;
3. Login and enter password when prompted: ./mysql -u root -p
4. Run SQL from command line terminal by using source and your file location: source /Users/[file location]/[filename].SQL
5. You can also write and save scripts to TXT file: tee /Users/[file location]/[filename].TXT
6. Run SQL scripts
7. Stop writing to TXT file: Notee

### Step 2: Import data to MySQL
- Table Data Import Wizard > browse for your external data
- Right click on schema to set default schema 

If you wish to access a pre-built fake database, you can connect node.js to MySQL using the faker package [faker.js](https://github.com/Marak/Faker.js#readme). TBD on steps to this. For now, customizing our dataset can help familiarize us with business questions.
