This post focuses on reviewing SQL aggregations and advanced SQL windows functions that are commonly asked during SQL interviews. Practicing is the best approach and sometimes customizing our dataset can help familiarize us with business questions.

### Step 1: First download MySQL
- Download and install to macOS applications [MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/)
- Open MySQL workbench, add a new connection (Host: 127.0.0.1, Port:3306), click on store in keychain to enter your laptop password 

If you wish to access pre-built fake data, you can connect node.js to MySQL using the faker package [faker.js](https://github.com/Marak/Faker.js#readme). TBD on steps to this.

### Step 2: Import external data to MySQL
- 

## SQL Aggregations

## SQL Window functions
