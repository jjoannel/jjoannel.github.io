Marketing departments often focus on Return On Investments (ROI) for any marketing efforts (types of advertising, promotions, events, etc.). 
In this example, using kaggle's advertising data, we want to be able to assess the effect of marketing efforts on sales and use a multiple linear regression model to predict changes in sales.

### Regression notation
Sales = β0 + β1 * facebook + β2 * instagram + β3 * youtube + ϵ

### Explore and plot data
- Dataset has 200 rows of data and 4 variables: facebook, instagram, youtube and sales
- Plotting the data, we see a linear relationship between facebook and sales, instagram and sales, and a non-linear relationships between youtube and sales. This suggests that every increase in facebook and instagram ads, we may see a possible increase in sales too.
- Correlation helps determine the strength of the relationships. A correlation close to +1 or -1 is pretty strong and correlation close to 0 is weaker. There is highly positive correlation of 0.90 between facebook ads and sales. 

```
library(tidyverse)

#Explore Data
ads <- read.csv(file = "01_advertising.csv")
head(ads)
summary(ads)

#Plots
ggplot(ads, aes(x = Facebook, y=Sales)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  stat_smooth()
ggplot(ads, aes(x = Instagram, y=Sales)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  stat_smooth()
ggplot(ads, aes(x = Youtube, y=Sales)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  stat_smooth()
  
#Find correlations
cor(ads$Sales, ads$Facebook)
cor(ads$Sales, ads$Instagram)
cor(ads$Sales, ads$Youtube)
```

### Interpretation of Regression model

```
#Multiple Linear Regression model
model1 <- lm(Sales~Facebook+Instagram+Youtube, data= ads)
summary(model1)

#Model Diagnostics
layout(matrix(c(1,2,3,4),2,2)) # optional 4 graphs/page 
plot(model1)
```
