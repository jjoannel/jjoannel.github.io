Marketing departments often focus on Return On Investments (ROI) for any marketing efforts (types of advertising, promotions, events, etc.). 
In this example, using kaggle's advertising data, we want to be able to assess the effect of marketing efforts on sales and use a multiple linear regression model to predict changes in sales. The goal is to provide a recommendation to increase sales using a specific marketing channel.

### Regression notation
Sales = β0 + β1 * facebook + β2 * instagram + β3 * youtube + ϵ

All 3 advertising budgets are the predictors for the sales response variable.

### Explore and plot data
- Dataset has 200 rows of data and 4 variables: facebook, instagram, youtube and sales. Assume all values are in the thousands.
- Plotting the data, we see a linear relationship between facebook and sales, instagram and sales, and a non-linear relationships between youtube and sales. This suggests that every increase in facebook and instagram ads, we may see a possible increase in sales too. This means that marketing efforts does impact sales!
- Correlation helps determine the strength of the relationships. A correlation close to +1 or -1 is pretty strong (highly accurate) and correlation close to 0 is weaker (random chance). There is highly positive correlation of 0.90 between facebook ads and sales.

```
library(tidyverse)

#Explore Data
ads <- read.csv(file = "01_advertising.csv")
head(ads)
summary(ads)

#Plots
ggplot(ads, aes(x = Facebook, y=Sales)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  stat_smooth()
ggplot(ads, aes(x = Instagram, y=Sales)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  stat_smooth()
ggplot(ads, aes(x = Youtube, y=Sales)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  stat_smooth()
  
#Find correlations
cor(ads$Sales, ads$Facebook)
cor(ads$Sales, ads$Instagram)
cor(ads$Sales, ads$Youtube)
```

### Interpretation of Regression model
Sales = 4.63 + 0.05 * facebook + 0.11 * instagram + 0.0003 * youtube + ϵ

- The intercept (β0) is 4.63, interpreted as the predicted sales for an advertising budget of zero.
- The regression coefficient (β1) shows that for an advertising budget equal to x facebook dollars, we can expect an increase of 0.05 units in sales. For example, Sales = 4.63 + 0.05 * cost of facebook ads $5000 = $254,630.

```
#Multiple Linear Regression model
model1 <- lm(Sales~Facebook+Instagram+Youtube, data= ads)
summary(model1)

#Model Diagnostics
layout(matrix(c(1,2,3,4),2,2)) # optional 4 graphs/page 
plot(model1)
