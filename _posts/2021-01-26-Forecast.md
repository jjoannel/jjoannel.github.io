Time series is used when there are sequentially observed data involved. There are 2 types of forecasting methods:
1) Qualitative: data unavailable
2) Quantitative: historical data available

**Steps to forecasting:**
1. Define the problem
2. Gather historical/statistical data
3. Exploratory analysis
4. Fit the model (regression, box-jenkins, hierarchical forecasts)
5. Evaluate the model
